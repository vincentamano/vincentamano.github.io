### CPSC 120


* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 was one of my favorites because I learned about how loops can be nested into each other, and create patterns in a very unique way. It also showed me how these loops can be used to create other scenarios other than creating patterns.

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 2 was another one of my favorites because it was the first of many small games we learned to code. This also taught me how these small games can also be used for user input for other programs.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1 was one of the last favorites I had. It showed us how to use command line arguments through the terminal, as well as what ArgC and ArgV meant. As well as learning how Linux works even more, which I appreciate.
